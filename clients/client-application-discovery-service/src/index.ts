 * <fullname>Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service</fullname>
 *          <p>Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects. It
 *       automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network dependencies in your
 *       on-premises data centers. For more information, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/">Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service FAQ</a>.
 *       Application Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and
 *       collecting data about your on-premises servers:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Agentless discovery</b> is recommended for environments
 *           that use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on each
 *           host. It does not work in non-VMware environments.</p>
 *                <ul>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the operating
 *               systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure
 *               assessment.</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about network dependencies, only
 *               agent-based discovery collects that information.</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                </ul>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Agent-based discovery</b> collects a richer set of data
 *           than agentless discovery by using the Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Agent, which you install
 *           on one or more hosts in your data center.</p>
 *                <ul>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p> The agent captures infrastructure and application information, including an
 *               inventory of running processes, system performance information, resource utilization,
 *               and network dependencies.</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the
 *               Application Discovery Service database in the cloud. </p>
 *                   </li>
 *                </ul>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Amazon Web Services Partner Network (APN) solutions</b> integrate with
 *           Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import details of your on-premises
 *           environment directly into Migration Hub without using the discovery connector or discovery
 *           agent.</p>
 *                <ul>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>Third-party application discovery tools can query Amazon Web Services Application Discovery
 *               Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery Service database using the
 *               public API.</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can
 *               associate applications with servers and track migrations.</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                </ul>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Recommendations</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments, and
 *       whenever you want to collect information about network dependencies. You can run agent-based
 *       and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless discovery to complete the initial
 *       infrastructure assessment quickly, and then install agents on select hosts to collect
 *       additional information.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Working With This Guide</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the
 *       actions and data types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows the
 *       API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to
 *       access an API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For
 *       more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services
 *       SDKs</a>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <ul>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>Remember that you must set your Migration Hub home region before you call any of
 *             these APIs.</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate, disassociate,
 *             import, or put) while in your home region, or a <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code>
 *             error is returned.</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted outside
 *             of your home region.</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>Although it is unlikely, the Migration Hub home region could change. If you call
 *             APIs outside the home region, an <code>InvalidInputException</code> is returned.</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>You must call <code>GetHomeRegion</code> to obtain the latest Migration Hub home
 *             region.</p>
 *                </li>
 *             </ul>
